# SoundLevelMeterSimulation
Sound Level Meter Simulation with STM32 and Proteus

* I did not share the project directly, as it may cause problems 
when opening the project on another computer.
* I shared main.c file, proteus schematic and pinout.

*** You need to use an LCD library.
* Link of the LCD library I used (You may need to make some changes to the LCD library.):

*** You must set an audio file for the audio source.

*** Values may be inaccurate because the simulation may not run in real time.
